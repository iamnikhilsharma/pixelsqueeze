## Design Concept

The logo represents the core concept of image optimization:
- **PS Monogram**: Stylized "P" and "S" letters representing "PixelSqueeze"
- **Compression Lines**: Horizontal lines showing data compression (more lines â†’ fewer lines)
- **Color scheme**: Indigo gradient for the icon, green accent for the "S" (compressed part)
- **Typography**: Inter font family for modern, professional look
- **Concept**: The "S" is smaller and more compressed than the "P", representing optimization

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Minimum size**: Logo should not be smaller than 120px width
2. **Clear space**: Maintain clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "P" in "Pixel"
3. **Background**: Use appropriate version (regular or white) based on background color
4. **Favicon**: Automatically served by the application's HTML head
